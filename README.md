# JWT Editor

*JWT Editor* is a Burp Suite extension which aims to be a Swiss Army Knife for manipulating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) within Burp Suite.
It provides detection of JWTs within both HTTP and WebSocket messages and allows for their editing,
signing, verifying, encryption and decryption. 
Additionally it facilitates several well-known attacks against JWT implementations.

## Overview
*JWT Editor* adds the follow functionality:

* A top level tab titled `JWT Editor`
* A custom tab `JSON Web Token` tab within HTTP messages containing JWTs
* JWT highlighting within proxied HTTP and WebSocket messages
* JWS Intruder payload provider
* JWS Scanner insertion point provider

## Loading JWT Editor
The easiest way of obtaining *JWT Editor* is via Burp Suite's [BAppStore](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/26aaa5ded2f74beea19e2ed8345a93dd).
See Burp Suite's [documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extensions/installing-extensions) for additional details.

## JWT Editor Tab
The top level `JWT Editor` tab allows cryptographic keys to be imported/exported, generated and converted between JWK and PEM formats.
Keys are stored within Burp Suite user options so are persisted between sessions.

New keys can be created using the buttons to the top right of the panel, which will bring up the relevant dialog.
Existing keys can be edited by double clicking on the corresponding row within the keys table.

<img src="gitimg/key_view.png" width="400"/>

Additional options can be found via the keys table context menu.

Using these options the selected key can either be deleted or exported to the clipboard.

### JSON Web Token Tab
The HTTP message editor `JSON Web Token` tab allows modification of JWTs within Burp Suite message editors.

<img src="gitimg/editor.png" width="600"/>

The editor view has two layouts, `JWS` and `JWE`, which are selected depending on whether a JSON Web Signature or JSON Web Encryption is detected.

#### Editable Fields

A JSON text editor is provided to edit each of the JWS and JWE components that contain JSON content:

* JWS Header
* JWS Payload
* JWE Header

A hex editor is provided to alter each of the JWS and JWE fields that contain binary content:

* JWS Signature
* JWE Encrypted Key
* JWE Initialization Vector
* JWE Ciphertext
* JWE Authentication Tag

#### Sign
`Sign` presents a signing dialog that can be used to update the Signature by signing the JWS Header and Payload using a 
key from the `JWT Editor Tab` that has signing capabilities

<img src="gitimg/sign.png" width="400"/>

#### Verify

`Verify` will attempt to verify the Signature of a JWS Header and Payload using any key that is capable of verification 
from the `JWT Editor Tab`. A dialog will be presented with the result of the verification operation.

<img src="gitimg/verify.png" width="600"/>

#### Encrypt

`Encrypt` presents an encryption dialog that can be used to encrypt the JWS Header, Payload and Signature fields to 
produce a JWE using a key from the `JWT Editor Tab` that is capable of encryption.

Encrypting a JWS will change the editor mode to `JWE` to allow modification of the JWE components after encryption.

<img src="gitimg/encrypt.png" width="400"/>

#### Decrypt
`Decrypt` will attempt to use the keys configured in the `JWT Editor Tab` that are capable of decryption to decrypt 
the content of a JWE to produce a JWS.

Decrypting a JWE will change the editor mode to `JWS` to allow modification of the JWS components after decryption.

#### Attack
The `Attack` option implements several well-known attacks against JSON Web Signatures:

* Embedded JWK
* 'none' Signing Algorithm
* HMAC Key Confusion
* Signing with an empty HMAC key
* Signing with a *Psychic signature*
* Embedding a Collaborator payload

These are described in more detail [below](#Attacks).

#### Format JSON
The `Format JSON` option on JSON fields automatically corrects the spacing and indentation of the JSON document.

#### Compact JSON
The handling of whitespace and newlines is important for a JSON Web Signature, as the encoded bytes of the JSON document are used to form the signature field. The `Compact JSON` option is used to control how the content of the JSON fields will be serialized.

When enabled, whitespace and newlines will be automatically stripped from the JSON document before serialization. When disabled, whitespace and newlines will be preserved.

This option is automatically enabled if it is detected that the original JWT did not contain whitespace or newlines.

## Building JWT Editor from source
*JWT Editor* can be built from source.
* Ensure that Java JDK 17 or newer is installed
* From root of project, run the command `./gradlew jar`
* This should place the JAR file `jwt-editor-2.2.1.jar` within the `build/libs` directory
* This can be loaded into Burp Suite by navigating to the `Extensions` tab, `Installed` sub-tab, clicking `Add` and loading the JAR file
* This BApp is using the newer Montoya API so it's best to use the latest version of Burp Suite (try the earlier adopter channel if there are issues with the latest stable release)

# Supported Algorithms

The following JWK types are supported:

* Octet Sequence (OCT) - AES/HMAC
* RSA
* Elliptic-Curve (ECC) - P-256, P-384, P-521
* Octet Key Pair (OKP) - x25519, x448, ed25519, ed448
* Passwords (PBES)

See [here](https://github.com/DolphFlynn/jwt-editor/wiki/Supported-Algorithms) for more details.

## Attacks

The JWT Editor automates several common attacks against JSON Web Signatures.

### 'none' Signing Algorithm

The value 'none' is defined in the JWA standard as an accepted signing algorithm for JWS. This is intended for use where an out-of-band method has been used to already verify the integrity of the JWS. However, some libraries have been found to treat this as a valid algorithm when processing a JWS.

This attack automates stripping of the signature value from a JWS.

### HMAC Key Confusion

Each algorithm within JWS has a required key type (RSA, EC, OKP or oct). A vulnerability has been identified within JOSE implementations where the key type provided in a JWS header does not match that of the algorithm specified. An attacker that provides a symmetric HS256/384/512 'alg' value with a asymmetric 'kty' (EC, RSA, OKP) value may cause the validating library to use the asymmetric public key as the symmetric key input to a HMAC signature validation. As the public key is known to the attacker, the attacker can use the public key as the input to their HMAC signature and forge a signature which is accepted by the server.

The tool implements this attack using the steps outlined at https://www.nccgroup.com/ae/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2019/january/jwt-attack-walk-through/.

### Embedded JWK

JWS defines a 'jwk' field within the Header which is used for the ECDH-ES algorithms as a method of transporting the public key to the recipient. However, this field has been mistakenly used by library implementations as a source of the key for signature verification. By creating a new key, embedding the key for verification within the header, and then signing the JWS Payload, an attacker is able to produce arbitrary JWT payloads.

### Signing with an empty HMAC key
This attack signs a JWS with using a symmetric signature algorithm and an empty shared secret.
[CVE-2019-20933](https://github.com/LorenzoTullini/InfluxDB-Exploit-CVE-2019-20933) is an example of using this
technique to bypass authentication.

### Signing with a *Psychic signature*
Some versions of Java between 15 and 18 failed to properly verify ECDSA signatures.
This became known as [Psychic Signatures](https://neilmadden.blog/2022/04/19/psychic-signatures-in-java/) or
CVE-2022-21449.

### Embedding a Collaborator payload
Burp Suite's [Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/collaborator) can be used to check if a server 
is fetching content based on the `x5u` or `jku` headers. 
Note that this functionality is only available in Burp Suite Professional.
